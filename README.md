### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi. My name is Josh Zumbrunn. At the beginning of 2023, I was laid off from my job driving trucks for Kroger. I saw this not as a setback, but the perfect opportunity to pursue a career that would enrich my mind and challenge me more than ever before. Not long after I was let go, I enrolled in an intensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp called App Academy. 
I had always been good with computers, but never pursued anything professionally. As soon as I enrolled in App Academy, I dove into programming languages like JavaScript and Python. I constructed multiple full-stack applications using React & Redux, Flask, and ExpressJs. In just 9 short months, I went from a complete beginner with 0 coding knowledge to a full-stack engineer. 
However, App Academy is only the beginning. I plan on expanding my knowledge of front-end frameworks like Angular and back-end frameworks like Django.
By the end of this journey, I want to have been a part of something that can make a real difference in tech or even the world.
